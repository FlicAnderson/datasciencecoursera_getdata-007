AIM: This README file will explain how run_analysis.R script works.  It should be used in combination with the codebook for this analysis - CODEBOOK.md.

Steps involved in this analysis: 
* 1. merge training & test sets to create one data set
* 2. extract only measurements on mean & standard deviation for ea. measurement
* 3. use descriptive activity names to name activities in the data set
* 4. appropriately label data set with descriptive variable names 
* 5. from descriptively named dataset, create second, independent tidy data set w/ average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
